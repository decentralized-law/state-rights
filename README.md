# Declaration of State Rights and Duties

PREAMBLE:

Whereas all states are equal in dignity and rights and represent the interests of their people, they should act toward one another in a spirit of brotherhood,

Considering that the equal and inalienable rights of all states are the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,

Recognizing that states, as fundamental legal actors, embody collective free will and establish an international legal order,

Acknowledging that the international legal order poses opportunities and challenges to the self-determination of states and peoples, affecting the liberty of individuals,

Observing that the international legal order imposes duties upon states through undemocratic processes that violate sovereign equality, advance particular ideologies, and lack fundamental checks and balances,

Understanding that state rights and duties exist independent of the jurisdiction of any entity within the society of nations,


### DECLARING THE FOLLOWING STATE RIGHTS AND DUTIES:

#### Article 1
Every state has the right to equality in law with every other state.

#### Article 2
Every state has the right to exercise jurisdiction over its territory and all persons and things therein.

#### Article 3
Every state has the right to independence and, therefore, to freely exercise all its legal powers without dictation by any other state, including the choice of its own form of government. Every state has the duty to respect the independence and form of government of all other states.

#### Article 4
Every state has the duty to treat all persons under its jurisdiction with respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and must prioritize these above other duties.

#### Article 5
Every state has the right to enter into treaties with other states and the duty to fulfill in good faith its treaty obligations.

#### Article 6
Every state has the right to defend its integrity and independence; to provide for its conservation and prosperity; to consequently organize itself as it sees fit; to legislate upon its interests and administer its services; to define the jurisdiction and competence of its courts; and to regulate its economy and resources.

#### Article 7
The territory of a state is inviolable and may not be the object of military occupation nor of other measures of subversion or force by another state, whether imposed directly or indirectly, for any motive, even temporarily.

#### Article 8
Every state has the duty to refrain from intervening in the internal or external affairs of any other state and from fomenting civil strife in the territory of another state.

#### Article 9
Every state has the duty to settle its disputes with other states by peaceful means and refrain from resorting to war as an instrument of national policy. States are to always observe established restrictions in the conduct of war.

#### Article 10
Every state has the right to individual or collective self-defense against armed attack and other forms of harmful interference in its sovereign affairs.


### LIMITATIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL LEGAL ORDER:

No state is subject to a permanent suprastate executive. A state of emergency cannot establish a permanent suprastate executive over a state. No state may be subject to a permanent international force. No state is subject to a permanent international court or regulatory body without its consent. No state may be taxed or regulated by non-state entities. No state may be denied its right to create and enforce its own laws, to engage in commerce and financial transactions, or to create and use a monetary system.

### About This Initiative

This project is part of an initiative to publish legal instruments on the blockchain. It demonstrates that decentralized blockchains can serve as a foundation for international legal principles. While this is a static on-chain publication, it invites reflection on new approaches to international law that transcend traditional jurisdictional frameworks.

The specific aim of the Declaration of State Rights and Duties is to return to a proper role for state legislators in relation to international law and international institutions.

## Why This Declaration?

The Declaration of State Rights and Duties addresses a critical failure in the current legal order. Before our eyes has emerged an international regulatory system that slowly erodes national sovereignty and individual liberty. It has no formal structures allowing public participation in creating, amending, or legally challenging its international standards and regulations. This has created a world of legislation without representation, where the legitimacy of governance is undermined and no appropriate checks and balances exist. Instead of protecting free exchange, cryptocurrency regulations especially are heavily geared towards supranational policy objectives.

This declaration is a start to reimagine the balance between state sovereignty and international governance structures. It establishes clear boundaries between international and national affairs, protecting state sovereignty and collective free will from international powers. By publishing this declaration in a decentralized fashion on the blockchain, it provides immutable, permanent, and universally accessible principles to guide humanity toward healthier forms of international cooperation. The declaration serves as a first step in offering an alternative vision for a multi-polar world and inspiring more informed debate on the proper role of international regulation.
