# Contributing to the Declaration of State Rights and Duties

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines for contributing translations and blockchain deployments of the Declaration of State Rights and Duties.

## How to Contribute

### Official Translations

To make these state rights and duties widely accessible, we welcome official translations into different languages. Great care was placed in selecting and drafting the Declaration, so to be considered for an official translation and become part of immutable legal history, please follow these Translation Guidelines.

**Important Translation Guidelines:**
- Translate the official version without additions or subtractions (basing your translation on [the PDF version](./assets/Declaration-of-State-Rights-and-Duties.pdf) is recommended).
- Maintain the same structure, order, and article numbering as the original.
- The translation must be published on a blockchain and as a PDF.
- The PDF version must be published with your (organization's) name, location, date, and open-source license.
- Verify terminology with legal and international relations experts if needed (we reserve the right to verify the translation).
- Translations from legal experts or official organizations will see priority acceptance.

#### To contribute a translation:

1. **Fork** this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page
2. **Create a new branch** for your translation (e.g., `translation-spanish`)
3. **Create the following files** in the `translations/[LANGUAGE]` folder:
   - HTML file: `StateRights-[LANGUAGE].html` - modify the provided `StateRightsFrontEnd.html` file with the address of your smart contract.
   - PDF file: Your official PDF version with your name/organization, location, date, time, and open-source license (CC0 1.0)
   - Contract info: A markdown file with your blockchain deployment details (contract address and network)
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your translation and verification information
5. If your translation meets our guidelines, we'll add you to the authors list on the main page

### Blockchain Deployments

If you wish to deploy the Declaration to additional blockchain networks:

1. **Choose a suitable blockchain** that provides permanent, immutable storage
2. **Deploy the text** following best practices for that specific blockchain
3. **Document your deployment** including:
   - Blockchain network used
   - Contract/transaction address
   - Deployment date
   - Any specific instructions for accessing the text on that blockchain
4. **Submit a pull request** with this information in a markdown file under the `deployments` directory

### Suggestions and Discussions

For suggestions, discussions, or questions:
- Open an **Issue** with a descriptive title
- Clearly explain your suggestion or question
- Tag appropriate categories to help sort and prioritize

## Review Process

All contributions will be reviewed for:
- Quality and accuracy
- Adherence to the project's purpose and values
- Technical correctness (for blockchain deployments)

Translations might undergo a verification process which may involve community review or input from native speakers and legal experts familiar with international law terminology.

## Code of Conduct

- **Respect**: Treat all contributors with respect and consideration
- **Focus**: Keep contributions relevant to the project's goals
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate your intentions and reasoning
- **Inclusivity**: Respect diverse perspectives and make contributions accessible

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in the project. Translators and blockchain deployers will be credited with their contributions in both the relevant files and in a contributors list.

Thank you for helping to spread and support these fundamental state rights and duties!
